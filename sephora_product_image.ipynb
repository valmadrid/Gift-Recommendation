Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.</td>\n",

       "3  Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.   \n",

       "1  Bumble and bumble began in 1977, as a New York City salon famed for its signature rebel-elegance. Right away, Bb. transcended hairdressing, crossing over into fashion and street-style. Like our idiosyncratic name, the brand would come to define infinite individuality. It was about more than a hairstyle. It was an attitude. We quickly clipped, colored, and styled our way into global prominence, with our like-minded salons and rock-star editorial team. Our runway looks launched global hair trends – and, in 1991, a backstage need jump-started our iconic product range. To this day, we remain passionately dedicated to the transformational power of hair.Bumble and bumble.Salon born. New York raised. Hair is what we ‘do.  \n",
