To conceal imperfections, uneven skin tone, or uneven texture: -Using the shade designed for your skin tone, apply BAREPRO Concealer directly from tube onto skin. -Pat in gently with ring finger. -For fuller coverage, blend out with a small, flat brush. -To diffuse coverage, blend with a dual-fiber brush.  -For best results, dust on Mineral Veil  (sold separately) with a soft, fluffy brush.  To add brightness to dull or sallow skin: -Use the shade designed for your skin tone or one shade lighter.  -Focus on the center planes of the face (such as the forehead, cheeks, bridge of nose, and chin) to accentuate and add brightness. This will help to counteract dullness. -Blend in using a dense brush, such as the bareMinerals Luxe Performance Brush (sold separately).  -Use a smaller brush to blend along the nose. -For best results, dust on Mineral Veil (sold separately) with a soft, fluffy brush.  To contour and highlight: -Select shades two to three intensities deeper and two to three intensities lighter than your skin tone (depending on desired level of contrast). -Using the deeper shade, apply in the hollow of the cheeks to sculpt and define cheekbones, and along the sides of the forehead, near the hairline, to visually shorten forehead. -Using the slanted edge, apply along sides of nose to make it look slimmer. -Using the lighter shade, apply directly above contour shade on cheeks, down bridge of nose, center of forehead, and chin to bring light to the center of the face. -Buff in the lighter highlight areas first, with long back and forth strokes, then blend in the deeper contour areas. -Use a smaller brush to blend nose contouring.   \n",
