       "      <td>Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.</td>\n",

       "3  Suggested Usage:  To conceal dark circles:  -Using the shade designed for your skin tone, glide BAREPRO Concealer under the eyes, starting from inner corner and moving outward. -Gently blend in using your ring finger.  -Finish by blending in with a small diffusing brush.  To conceal imperfections, uneven skin tone, or uneven texture: -Using the shade designed for your skin tone, apply BAREPRO Concealer directly from tube onto skin. -Pat in gently with ring finger. -For fuller coverage, blend out with a small, flat brush. -To diffuse coverage, blend with a dual-fiber brush.  -For best results, dust on Mineral Veil  (sold separately) with a soft, fluffy brush.  To add brightness to dull or sallow skin: -Use the shade designed for your skin tone or one shade lighter.  -Focus on the center planes of the face (such as the forehead, cheeks, bridge of nose, and chin) to accentuate and add brightness. This will help to counteract dullness. -Blend in using a dense brush, such as the bareMinerals Luxe Performance Brush (sold separately).  -Use a smaller brush to blend along the nose. -For best results, dust on Mineral Veil (sold separately) with a soft, fluffy brush.  To contour and highlight: -Select shades two to three intensities deeper and two to three intensities lighter than your skin tone (depending on desired level of contrast). -Using the deeper shade, apply in the hollow of the cheeks to sculpt and define cheekbones, and along the sides of the forehead, near the hairline, to visually shorten forehead. -Using the slanted edge, apply along sides of nose to make it look slimmer. -Using the lighter shade, apply directly above contour shade on cheeks, down bridge of nose, center of forehead, and chin to bring light to the center of the face. -Buff in the lighter highlight areas first, with long back and forth strokes, then blend in the deeper contour areas. -Use a smaller brush to blend nose contouring.   \n",
       "4  Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "2  Bumble and bumble began in 1977, as a New York City salon famed for its signature rebel-elegance. Right away, Bb. transcended hairdressing, crossing over into fashion and street-style. Like our idiosyncratic name, the brand would come to define infinite individuality. It was about more than a hairstyle. It was an attitude. We quickly clipped, colored, and styled our way into global prominence, with our like-minded salons and rock-star editorial team. Our runway looks launched global hair trends – and, in 1991, a backstage need jump-started our iconic product range. To this day, we remain passionately dedicated to the transformational power of hair.Bumble and bumble.Salon born. New York raised. Hair is what we ‘do.  \n",
