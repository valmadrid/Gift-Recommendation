Normal   Oily   Combination   Dry   Sensitive    What it is:   A deeply hydrating, ultra-rich cream to comfort and treat dry, tight skin as it brightens, smooths, visibly firms, and nourishes.    Solutions for:   - Dryness  - Dullness and uneven texture  - Fine lines and wrinkles    If you want to know more…  A game changer for parched, aging skin.  Because dry skin exacerbates all signs of aging, this luxurious, whipped formula has been created to instantly relieve that tight, parched feeling. A richer version of Caudalie’s coveted Premier Cru The Cream, it acts like a rich cloud of comfort to combat excessive dryness while addressing all signs of aging. Caudalie’s clinically proven, anti-aging complexes actively restore skin: resveratrol lifts and firms, Viniferine  brightens, and grape seed polyphenols protect against environmental aggressors. Three super concentrated plant waxes jojoba, mimosa, and sunflower flood skin with hydration and create a protective barrier to prevent moisture loss. The formula is also infused with plumping peptides to fill out any loss of firmness. Daily use results in remarkable changes: touchably soft, thoroughly hydrated, dramatically smooth, visibly lifted, gorgeously glowing skin.     What else you need to know:   Founded on their family vineyard in Bordeaux France, Mathilde and Bertrand Thomas created the first skincare brand to harness the natural antioxidant powers of the grapevine. Since the beginning, the 100 percent family-owned company has always sourced natural and environmentally conscious ingredients, while collaborating with leading medical schools such as Harvard Medical School. Each formula created is held to the highest of standards: natural, effective, and luxurious free of synthetic and harmful ingredients with no animal testing. Caudalie never uses parabens, phenoxyethenol, phtalates, mineral oil, sodium laureth sulfate, or animal ingredients in their formulas.  This product is vegan, non-toxic, cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, and free of all synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, fillers, gluten, and GMOs.     Research results:  In a clinical study/self-evaluation on 41 volunteers:  - 78% saw smoothed wrinkles  - 76% saw firmer-looking skin  - 85% saw a more even complexion  - 88% said skin stayed nourished all day long      Clean at Sephora  Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

       "      <td>Which skin type is it good for?    Normal   Oily   Combination   Dry   Sensitive    What it is:  A powerhouse serum that improves visible signs of aging while firming, smoothing, brightening, and supporting skin’s natural collagen production.    Solutions for:   - Fine lines and wrinkles  - Loss of firmness and elasticity  - Dullness and uneven texture    If you want to know more…  This power-packed serum is a natural and effective time machine for the skin. It reenergizes sluggish skin cells so they act younger and perform their critical functions, like natural collagen synthesis more effectively. With every application, skin cells work faster and harder to firm, tone, brighten, and smooth. Or in other words, return skin to its most youthful state. This serum is formulated with Caudalie’s three signature patents: resveratrol to visibly lift and firm, Viniferine  to brighten, and grape seed polyphenols to protect against environmental aggressors. Together, these powerhouse ingredients further enhance the serum’s anti-aging benefits and boost the effectiveness of any subsequent cream. The formula is further enriched with niacinimide (vitamin B3) to protect skin from UV damage, age spots, and hyperpigmentation, as well as boost hydration and act as an anti-inflammatory. The silky, weightless texture glides over skin and absorbs quickly and features a subtle, natural rose scent.     What else you need to know:   Powering this support in skin cell energy is Vinergy , a breakthrough anti-aging complex co-patented with Harvard Medical School. It took five years to perfect the Vinergy formula, which is exclusive to this innovative serum.    For the past five years, I have collaborated with Caudalie to research and develop ground-breaking, anti-aging innovations. Together we've discovered a solution to counteract the diminishing energy metabolism of our cells over time, which is a key reason our skin ages. Our groundbreaking discovery of vinergy helps to restore the cells' mitochondrial mass and energy production, which in turn allows our cells to defend against aging.  Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School   This product is vegan, non-toxic, cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and pregnancy, and free all fillers, gluten, and GMOs.     Research results:  In clinical tests:  - +46% increase in skin’s natural collagen production     Clean at Sephora  Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

       "11  Which skin type is it good for?    Normal   Oily   Combination   Dry   Sensitive    What it is:  A powerhouse serum that improves visible signs of aging while firming, smoothing, brightening, and supporting skin’s natural collagen production.    Solutions for:   - Fine lines and wrinkles  - Loss of firmness and elasticity  - Dullness and uneven texture    If you want to know more…  This power-packed serum is a natural and effective time machine for the skin. It reenergizes sluggish skin cells so they act younger and perform their critical functions, like natural collagen synthesis more effectively. With every application, skin cells work faster and harder to firm, tone, brighten, and smooth. Or in other words, return skin to its most youthful state. This serum is formulated with Caudalie’s three signature patents: resveratrol to visibly lift and firm, Viniferine  to brighten, and grape seed polyphenols to protect against environmental aggressors. Together, these powerhouse ingredients further enhance the serum’s anti-aging benefits and boost the effectiveness of any subsequent cream. The formula is further enriched with niacinimide (vitamin B3) to protect skin from UV damage, age spots, and hyperpigmentation, as well as boost hydration and act as an anti-inflammatory. The silky, weightless texture glides over skin and absorbs quickly and features a subtle, natural rose scent.     What else you need to know:   Powering this support in skin cell energy is Vinergy , a breakthrough anti-aging complex co-patented with Harvard Medical School. It took five years to perfect the Vinergy formula, which is exclusive to this innovative serum.    For the past five years, I have collaborated with Caudalie to research and develop ground-breaking, anti-aging innovations. Together we've discovered a solution to counteract the diminishing energy metabolism of our cells over time, which is a key reason our skin ages. Our groundbreaking discovery of vinergy helps to restore the cells' mitochondrial mass and energy production, which in turn allows our cells to defend against aging.  Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School   This product is vegan, non-toxic, cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and pregnancy, and free all fillers, gluten, and GMOs.     Research results:  In clinical tests:  - +46% increase in skin’s natural collagen production     Clean at Sephora  Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.
