       "      <td>A new signature for the modern Gucci man, Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme combines classic masculine appeal with cool, contemporary elegance. This iconic fragrance culminates both vision and tradition, encompassing Gucci's iconic, luxurious heritage. With its warm, intense scent, Gucci by Gucci Pour Homme speaks to the powerful, sensual man who embodies the brand's rich legacy.  The top and the heart of this essence deliver a smooth, crisp freshness with a touch of cypress and calone. Violet and bergamot create a masculine floralcy for natural and timeless appeal. A unique heart distinguishes the scent and intensifies its character with incense, leather accord, and a subtly sweet note of tobacco. Amber lavishes the aroma with a warm embrace of longevity and depth, while black pepper adds hints of sparkling effect. The base is completed with woody layers of patchouli, cedarwood, and amyris. The sleek horsebit-adorned flacon reflects the undeniably elegant appeal that is quintessentially Gucci.   Notes:  Bergamot, Cypress, Violet Incense, Jasmine, Tobacco Leaves, Patchouli, Amber.  Style:  Confident. Masculine. Refined.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to 9%, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14%. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to 9%, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14%. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.</td>\n",

Intimate and magical lilac flower is laced with amber to radiate warmth and grace at the fragrance’s heart.   A new chapter unfolds in the Gucci Guilty legacy. The generation that inspires Alessandro Michele is characterized by a celebrative anarchy. They don’t believe in conformity or in submitting to labels or gender rules. They break free from common social boundaries. The original Gucci Guilty fragrances embody this new edge and signify freedom by breaking with traditional male and female fragrance ingredients.   #GuiltyNotGuilty    Notes:   Geranium, Pink Pepper, Lilac, Peach, Amber, Patchouli.

Intimate and magical lilac flower is laced with amber to radiate warmth and grace at the fragrance’s heart.   A new chapter unfolds in the Gucci Guilty legacy. The generation that inspires Alessandro Michele is characterized by a celebrative anarchy. They don’t believe in conformity or in submitting to labels or gender rules. They break free from common social boundaries. The original Gucci Guilty fragrances embody this new edge and signify freedom by breaking with traditional male and female fragrance ingredients.   #GuiltyNotGuilty    Notes:   Geranium, Pink Pepper, Lilac, Peach, Amber, Patchouli.

       "2     Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to 9%, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14%.
