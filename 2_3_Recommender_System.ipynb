Skin Type:  Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily    Skincare Concerns:  Fine Lines and Wrinkles, Dark Spots, and Dullness and Uneven Texture    Ingredient Callouts:  Free of sulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, triclosan, and triclocarban, and contains less than one percent of synthetic fragrances. This product is also cruelty-free, and gluten-free, and comes in recyclable packaging.    What Else You Need to Know:  This tool uses microneedles to glide over the skin, and skin’s natural rejuvenation response is ignited, supporting cells to restore volume and glow from the inside out. It also uses LED red-light therapy and microcurrent stimulation to help stimulate cellular turnover and magnify results.     Any dermatologist will tell you that you have to wound the skin to regenerate the skin. Before GloPRO , our only choices were laser, chemical peels, and micro-dermabrasions with lots of downtime, expense, and inconvenience. GloPRO  changed everything. Now we can vertically target without having to strip the skin, which means zero downtime plus all the firming upsides in less than a minute a day. It’s without doubt the biggest breakthrough the industry has had in two decades.

       "      <td>Beauty Benefit:   Glowing Skin (minimizes look of enlarged pores, dark circles, and wrinkles), Stronger Hair and Nails, and Stronger Digestive and Immune Health    What it is:    A kit of 30 anti-aging ingestible skincare drink mixes formulated with marine collagen, probiotics, biotin, and antioxidant-packed lucuma to help replenish you for stronger skin, thicker-looking hair and better health.    What it tastes like:   - Original: nutty and caramel-like (because lucuma is a superfruit that sweetens and enhances already flavored beverages like coffee, smoothies, and protein shakes; unlike other sweeteners, lucuma powder is all-natural and low-calorie)\\t  - Matcha: strong green tea  - Tumeric: chai but spicier; with cinnamon and ginger, is it aromatic with a full body\\t    How to use:  Consume in the morning, before ingesting any other foods    Dosage:  One to two crushes, every day for 4 weeks    When to expect results:  One to three days of daily dosage for better health (digestion/immune system), two to three weeks of daily dosage for better skin, one month of daily dosage for better hair    What Else You Need to Know:   As you get older, your body starts to lose its ability to produce collagen, the super-protein that makes up over 75 percent of your skin, hair, nails, bones, and muscles. Without these gatekeepers of hydration and moisture, your body starts to show signs of aging, like wrinkles, dark circles, and thinning hair. However, drinking Crushed Tonic daily for two to four weeks can improve your skin and hair from within. These highly effective and clinically proven, marine collagen-based formulas work to replenish you from head to your toe.    Founding story: Founder Sally discovered the power of ingestible skincare after experiencing painful burns up and down both of her arms. When topical creams and ointments didn't work, she had to turn to drinking collagen to speed her recovery. Soon, she was seeing results not just in her arms, but everywhere on her body: her hair was becoming thicker and stronger than it's ever been, and she no longer was struggling with dry skin and dark circles under her eyes.      Clinical Results:  Clinical study part A (40 participants, females around the age of 55, and 12 weeks); using a cutometer, a skin elasticity meter that analyzes skin's elasticity by measuring the time and quality of skin's ability to return to the original state after stretching and pulling it, respondents reported:  - 18% increase in skin firmness  - 27.2% decrease in skin elasticity  - 22.8% increase in skin hydration   Clinical study part B (40 participants, females around the age of 55, and 12 weeks); by measuring the shadows created by one's wrinkles pre and post study, surveyed respondents reported:  - Significant decrease in wrinkles (average of -9.73%) by week 12    After drinking Crushed Tonic every day for 4 weeks, focus group  of 50 respondents:  - 97% saw an increase in skin hydration and firmness  - 97% saw a decrease in look of under-eye dark circles  - 97% saw reduced wrinkles and enlarged pores  - 94% saw thicker, stronger hair, and a boost in hair growth  - 100% saw quicker muscle recovery, stronger joints and bones, and an improvement in metabolism, digestion, and immune health</td>\n",

       "      <td>Which skin type is it good for?    Normal   Oily   Combination   Dry   Sensitive    What it is:  A powerhouse serum that improves visible signs of aging while firming, smoothing, brightening, and supporting skin’s natural collagen production.    Solutions for:   - Fine lines and wrinkles  - Loss of firmness and elasticity  - Dullness and uneven texture    If you want to know more…  This power-packed serum is a natural and effective time machine for the skin. It reenergizes sluggish skin cells so they act younger and perform their critical functions, like natural collagen synthesis more effectively. With every application, skin cells work faster and harder to firm, tone, brighten, and smooth. Or in other words, return skin to its most youthful state. This serum is formulated with Caudalie’s three signature patents: resveratrol to visibly lift and firm, Viniferine  to brighten, and grape seed polyphenols to protect against environmental aggressors. Together, these powerhouse ingredients further enhance the serum’s anti-aging benefits and boost the effectiveness of any subsequent cream. The formula is further enriched with niacinimide (vitamin B3) to protect skin from UV damage, age spots, and hyperpigmentation, as well as boost hydration and act as an anti-inflammatory. The silky, weightless texture glides over skin and absorbs quickly and features a subtle, natural rose scent.     What else you need to know:   Powering this support in skin cell energy is Vinergy , a breakthrough anti-aging complex co-patented with Harvard Medical School. It took five years to perfect the Vinergy formula, which is exclusive to this innovative serum.    For the past five years, I have collaborated with Caudalie to research and develop ground-breaking, anti-aging innovations. Together we've discovered a solution to counteract the diminishing energy metabolism of our cells over time, which is a key reason our skin ages. Our groundbreaking discovery of vinergy helps to restore the cells' mitochondrial mass and energy production, which in turn allows our cells to defend against aging.  Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School   This product is vegan, non-toxic, cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and pregnancy, and free all fillers, gluten, and GMOs.     Research results:  In clinical tests:  - +46% increase in skin’s natural collagen production     Clean at Sephora  Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

What else you need to know:   Generations of geisha lived, slept, and bathed in silk. These beautiful artists were draped in over 12 yards of exquisite kimono silk everyday. While they did not know the science behind this lustrous fabric, a 200-year old beauty text reveals that they knew how to use silk to smooth and soften their skin. This time-honored practice to beautify the geisha’s skin inspired The Silk Cream.  This pure formula is noncomedogenic, non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, and cruelty-free. It is formulated without mineral oil, synthetic fragrances, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, or TEA.   Beauty that gives back: every Tatcha purchase you make supports girls’ education around the world.

Perfected through centuries, it’s widely believed that their beauty secrets were passed down from one generation of geisha to the next by word of mouth alone. TATCHA rediscovered these coveted daily regimes in a 200-year-old manuscript. In homage to these icons of Eastern beauty, a proprietary process was developed with scientists, scholars, and geisha themselves, involving the very best green teas, Okinawa red algae, and rice bran.

Normal   Oily   Combination   Dry   Sensitive    What it is:   A deeply hydrating, ultra-rich cream to comfort and treat dry, tight skin as it brightens, smooths, visibly firms, and nourishes.    Solutions for:   - Dryness  - Dullness and uneven texture  - Fine lines and wrinkles    If you want to know more…  A game changer for parched, aging skin.  Because dry skin exacerbates all signs of aging, this luxurious, whipped formula has been created to instantly relieve that tight, parched feeling. A richer version of Caudalie’s coveted Premier Cru The Cream, it acts like a rich cloud of comfort to combat excessive dryness while addressing all signs of aging. Caudalie’s clinically proven, anti-aging complexes actively restore skin: resveratrol lifts and firms, Viniferine  brightens, and grape seed polyphenols protect against environmental aggressors. Three super concentrated plant waxes jojoba, mimosa, and sunflower flood skin with hydration and create a protective barrier to prevent moisture loss. The formula is also infused with plumping peptides to fill out any loss of firmness. Daily use results in remarkable changes: touchably soft, thoroughly hydrated, dramatically smooth, visibly lifted, gorgeously glowing skin.     What else you need to know:   Founded on their family vineyard in Bordeaux France, Mathilde and Bertrand Thomas created the first skincare brand to harness the natural antioxidant powers of the grapevine. Since the beginning, the 100 percent family-owned company has always sourced natural and environmentally conscious ingredients, while collaborating with leading medical schools such as Harvard Medical School. Each formula created is held to the highest of standards: natural, effective, and luxurious free of synthetic and harmful ingredients with no animal testing.

This product is vegan, non-toxic, cruelty-free, hypoallergenic, and free of all synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, fillers, gluten, and GMOs.     Research results:  In a clinical study/self-evaluation on 41 volunteers:  - 78% saw smoothed wrinkles  - 76% saw firmer-looking skin  - 85% saw a more even complexion  - 88% said skin stayed nourished all day long      Clean at Sephora  Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Any dermatologist will tell you that you have to wound the skin to regenerate the skin. Before GloPRO , our only choices were laser, chemical peels, and micro-dermabrasions with lots of downtime, expense, and inconvenience. GloPRO  changed everything.

       "7   Beauty Benefit:   Glowing Skin (minimizes look of enlarged pores, dark circles, and wrinkles), Stronger Hair and Nails, and Stronger Digestive and Immune Health    What it is:    A kit of 30 anti-aging ingestible skincare drink mixes formulated with marine collagen, probiotics, biotin, and antioxidant-packed lucuma to help replenish you for stronger skin, thicker-looking hair and better health.    What it tastes like:   - Original: nutty and caramel-like (because lucuma is a superfruit that sweetens and enhances already flavored beverages like coffee, smoothies, and protein shakes; unlike other sweeteners, lucuma powder is all-natural and low-calorie)\\t  - Matcha: strong green tea  - Tumeric: chai but spicier; with cinnamon and ginger, is it aromatic with a full body\\t    How to use:  Consume in the morning, before ingesting any other foods    Dosage:  One to two crushes, every day for 4 weeks    When to expect results:  One to three days of daily dosage for better health (digestion/immune system), two to three weeks of daily dosage for better skin, one month of daily dosage for better hair    What Else You Need to Know:   As you get older, your body starts to lose its ability to produce collagen, the super-protein that makes up over 75 percent of your skin, hair, nails, bones, and muscles. Without these gatekeepers of hydration and moisture, your body starts to show signs of aging, like wrinkles, dark circles, and thinning hair. However, drinking Crushed Tonic daily for two to four weeks can improve your skin and hair from within. These highly effective and clinically proven, marine collagen-based formulas work to replenish you from head to your toe.    Founding story: Founder Sally discovered the power of ingestible skincare after experiencing painful burns up and down both of her arms. When topical creams and ointments didn't work, she had to turn to drinking collagen to speed her recovery. Soon, she was seeing results not just in her arms, but everywhere on her body: her hair was becoming thicker and stronger than it's ever been, and she no longer was struggling with dry skin and dark circles under her eyes.      Clinical Results:  Clinical study part A (40 participants, females around the age of 55, and 12 weeks); using a cutometer, a skin elasticity meter that analyzes skin's elasticity by measuring the time and quality of skin's ability to return to the original state after stretching and pulling it, respondents reported:  - 18% increase in skin firmness  - 27.2% decrease in skin elasticity  - 22.8% increase in skin hydration   Clinical study part B (40 participants, females around the age of 55, and 12 weeks); by measuring the shadows created by one's wrinkles pre and post study, surveyed respondents reported:  - Significant decrease in wrinkles (average of -9.73%) by week 12    After drinking Crushed Tonic every day for 4 weeks, focus group  of 50 respondents:  - 97% saw an increase in skin hydration and firmness  - 97% saw a decrease in look of under-eye dark circles  - 97% saw reduced wrinkles and enlarged pores  - 94% saw thicker, stronger hair, and a boost in hair growth  - 100% saw quicker muscle recovery, stronger joints and bones, and an improvement in metabolism, digestion, and immune health   \n",

Normal   Oily   Combination   Dry   Sensitive    What it is:  A powerhouse serum that improves visible signs of aging while firming, smoothing, brightening, and supporting skin’s natural collagen production.    Solutions for:   - Fine lines and wrinkles  - Loss of firmness and elasticity  - Dullness and uneven texture    If you want to know more…  This power-packed serum is a natural and effective time machine for the skin. It reenergizes sluggish skin cells so they act younger and perform their critical functions, like natural collagen synthesis more effectively. With every application, skin cells work faster and harder to firm, tone, brighten, and smooth. Or in other words, return skin to its most youthful state. This serum is formulated with Caudalie’s three signature patents: resveratrol to visibly lift and firm, Viniferine  to brighten, and grape seed polyphenols to protect against environmental aggressors. Together, these powerhouse ingredients further enhance the serum’s anti-aging benefits and boost the effectiveness of any subsequent cream. The formula is further enriched with niacinimide (vitamin B3) to protect skin from UV damage, age spots, and hyperpigmentation, as well as boost hydration and act as an anti-inflammatory. The silky, weightless texture glides over skin and absorbs quickly and features a subtle, natural rose scent.     What else you need to know:   Powering this support in skin cell energy is Vinergy , a breakthrough anti-aging complex co-patented with Harvard Medical School. It took five years to perfect the Vinergy formula, which is exclusive to this innovative serum.    For the past five years, I have collaborated with Caudalie to research and develop ground-breaking, anti-aging innovations. Together we've discovered a solution to counteract the diminishing energy metabolism of our cells over time, which is a key reason our skin ages. Our groundbreaking discovery of vinergy helps to restore the cells' mitochondrial mass and energy production, which in turn allows our cells to defend against aging.

       "10  For over 300 years, Japan’s geisha have been held in awe for their enduring wisdom and breathtakingly beautiful, porcelain skin. Perfected through centuries, it’s widely believed that their beauty secrets were passed down from one generation of geisha to the next by word of mouth alone. TATCHA rediscovered these coveted daily regimes in a 200-year-old manuscript. In homage to these icons of Eastern beauty, a proprietary process was developed with scientists, scholars, and geisha themselves, involving the very best green teas, Okinawa red algae, and rice bran. The secrets of the geisha live on in TATCHA.\\n\\n                                                                                          \n",
