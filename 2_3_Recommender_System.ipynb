When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t.

       "      <td>Which skin type is it good for?     Normal    Oily    Combination    Dry     Sensitive     What it is:   A signature, 100 percent organic formula that’s suitable for even the most sensitive skin and extracted directly from grapes in Bordeaux, with the dual power to both increase hydration and reduce sensitivity.     Solutions for:   - Dryness  - Dullness and uneven texture  - Redness     If you want to know more…    A cult favorite among makeup artists and celebrities, Grape Water provides an immediate benefit of improved hydration and diminished skin sensitivity upon use. Rich in moisturizing polysaccharides, mineral salts, and potassium, Grape Water has an intense ability to retain water. Perfect for sensitive skin and the perfect go-to after any harsh peels or uncomfortable irritation, it acts as a calming treatment soothing rosacea, reducing redness and sensitivity, and calming rashes. The unique composition with mineral and active plant ingredients strengthens the skin's barrier function, making it more resilient and less sensitive over time. The versatile product can be used as a toner after cleansing, as a setting spray before applying makeup, or to refresh and hydrate the skin throughout the day.     What else you need to know:    This product is vegan.  Makeup pro tip: dampen makeup sponge to give dewy glow to foundation. Dampen eyeshadow brush to intensify shadow pigment. Caudalie founder Mathilde Thomas discovered this precious water on her parent’s vineyard in Bordeaux when her family during the harvest to extract water from the grapes.      This is literally pure grape water, so you can think of this as like a fire hydrant for your face. If you have irritation, if you have dryness, if you have anything that is going on that you just want to soothe it, calm it, hydrate it, bring it back to normal that’s what this does and it’s incredible. Plus, you can set your makeup in the end with it, too!  David Razzano, Sephora Pro Artist     Our entire Sephora Pro Team is obsessed with this because we realize that it takes away redness in the skin, so it’s perfect for a person like myself who gets super flushed every time I do any activity at all. This is like a quick fix because it just takes the redness down pretty immediately. We use it backstage a lot in fashion week because it basically takes down that redness.  Helen Phillips, Sephora Pro Artist     Research results:   In a corneometry, 12 volunteers:  - +127% immediate hydration    In a clinical test, 20 volunteers:  - -62% in skin sensitivity    Clean at Sephora  Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

       "      <td>It started out as a renewable energy project—and turned into an unexpected antiaging discovery. Algenist comes from a team of biotechnology scientists based in San Francisco. They were working on developing microalgae-based renewable energy solutions when they uncovered Alguronic Acid, a powerful compound responsible for regenerating and protecting the microalgae cell. When scientifically tested, it demonstrated significant antiaging properties, too. The result? A breakthrough skincare collection that offers never-before-seen technology for rejuvenated, younger-looking skin at any age.</td>\n",

Really saturate your skin with an essence and apply serum while skin is still damp. It’ll help a little bit of serum go a long way and maximize results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Drunk Elephant also included mini Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil so you get the best results.  Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. They never take into account whether something is synthetic or natural, instead choosing ingredients based on biocompatibility. That’s why they focus on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support and maintain the skin’s acid mantle. But what they leave out of their products is just as important as what they put into them, so you will never find what they call the Suspicious 6 (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, SLS) in their line. Drunk Elephant believes that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue, and when they’re removed entirely from your routine that is, when you take a Drunk Break  skin can reset and return to its healthiest, most balanced state. This ingredient-elimination diet benefits all skin types and inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies that chronicles the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found not only healthier skin but more importantly, healthier self-confidence.

Drunk Elephant also included mini Virgin Marula Luxury Facial Oil so you get the best results.  Drunk Elephant is committed to using only ingredients that either directly benefit the health of the skin or support the integrity of their formulations. They never take into account whether something is synthetic or natural, instead choosing ingredients based on biocompatibility. That’s why they focus on healthy pH levels, formulations the skin recognizes, small molecular structure that’s easily absorbed, and effective active ingredients that also support and maintain the skin’s acid mantle. But what they leave out of their products is just as important as what they put into them, so you will never find what they call the Suspicious 6 (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/dyes, SLS) in their line. Drunk Elephant believes that these six ubiquitous ingredients are at the root of almost every skin issue, and when they’re removed entirely from your routine that is, when you take a Drunk Break  skin can reset and return to its healthiest, most balanced state. This ingredient-elimination diet benefits all skin types and inspired the #barewithus Instagram movement, a collection of bare-faced selfies that chronicles the Drunk Elephant journeys of people who have found not only healthier skin but more importantly, healthier self-confidence.  Drunk Elephant is a supporter of IEF (International Elephant Foundation) and is cruelty-free.
