When we started this journey nearly 19 years ago, we knew one thing for certain: There were plenty of skincare companies that made luxury, efficacious products for women, but no one was addressing the needs of the modern man. So we stayed close to our customers (we still do) and listened to what they wanted—and what they didn’t.

       "      <td>Which skin type is it good for?     Normal    Oily    Combination    Dry     Sensitive     What it is:   A signature, 100 percent organic formula that’s suitable for even the most sensitive skin and extracted directly from grapes in Bordeaux, with the dual power to both increase hydration and reduce sensitivity.     Solutions for:   - Dryness  - Dullness and uneven texture  - Redness     If you want to know more…    A cult favorite among makeup artists and celebrities, Grape Water provides an immediate benefit of improved hydration and diminished skin sensitivity upon use. Rich in moisturizing polysaccharides, mineral salts, and potassium, Grape Water has an intense ability to retain water. Perfect for sensitive skin and the perfect go-to after any harsh peels or uncomfortable irritation, it acts as a calming treatment soothing rosacea, reducing redness and sensitivity, and calming rashes. The unique composition with mineral and active plant ingredients strengthens the skin's barrier function, making it more resilient and less sensitive over time. The versatile product can be used as a toner after cleansing, as a setting spray before applying makeup, or to refresh and hydrate the skin throughout the day.     What else you need to know:    This product is vegan.  Makeup pro tip: dampen makeup sponge to give dewy glow to foundation. Dampen eyeshadow brush to intensify shadow pigment. Caudalie founder Mathilde Thomas discovered this precious water on her parent’s vineyard in Bordeaux when her family during the harvest to extract water from the grapes.      This is literally pure grape water, so you can think of this as like a fire hydrant for your face. If you have irritation, if you have dryness, if you have anything that is going on that you just want to soothe it, calm it, hydrate it, bring it back to normal that’s what this does and it’s incredible. Plus, you can set your makeup in the end with it, too!  David Razzano, Sephora Pro Artist     Our entire Sephora Pro Team is obsessed with this because we realize that it takes away redness in the skin, so it’s perfect for a person like myself who gets super flushed every time I do any activity at all. This is like a quick fix because it just takes the redness down pretty immediately. We use it backstage a lot in fashion week because it basically takes down that redness.  Helen Phillips, Sephora Pro Artist     Research results:   In a corneometry, 12 volunteers:  - +127% immediate hydration    In a clinical test, 20 volunteers:  - -62% in skin sensitivity    Clean at Sephora  Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more.

Really saturate your skin with an essence and apply serum while skin is still damp. It’ll help a little bit of serum go a long way and maximize results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "      <td>Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent. -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly. -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse offthe scent. -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.   Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent, EDP contains more, usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs, therefore, last longer and smell more intense.</td>\n",

       "71  Fragrance Family:  Fresh   Scent Type:  Fresh Aquatics   Key Notes:  Hawaiian Green Mango, Cypress Oil, Deep Ocean Accord   Fragrance Description:  The heart of the fragrance is aromatic cypress and clary sage which add another level of sophistication, freshness, and sensuality.  The scent peaks with the salty mineral Deep Ocean Accord that energizes and activates an even deeper level of freshness.   About the Bottle:  Inspired by the swell of an epic wave, the Deep Blue bottle, with its gradated blue glass and silver accents, echoes the energy and intensity of the deep blue sea and the glint of sun on the water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent.    Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?:   The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil.

       "71  Suggested Usage:  -Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting, stronger scent.  -After applying, avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance, causing it to wear off more quickly.  -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists, be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing, as this tends to rinse off the scent.  -Replace fragrance after 12 months.

We bridge the gap between mass market and high-end haircare because who says good hair has to be out of reach?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
